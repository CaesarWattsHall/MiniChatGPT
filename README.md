# MiniChatGPT
This program uses the openai library to interact with the GPT-3 API. You’ll need to have an OpenAI API key and have it set up with the openai_secret_manager to use this program. You can then run the program and type in your prompts to chat with the chatbot. Type “quit” to exit the program.
